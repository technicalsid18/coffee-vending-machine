Coffee Vending Machine â˜•

Description
This Python program simulates a coffee vending machine. The program offers multiple coffee options, handles payment, and maintains inventory of ingredients. It is designed to be a simple command-line application that demonstrates basic concepts of Python, such as functions, loops, and conditional statements.

Features
Coffee Menu: Offers a selection of coffee options including Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
Payment System: Accepts payments and calculates change if needed.
Inventory Management: Tracks the ingredients (water, milk, coffee beans) and notifies when a refill is needed.
Customizable: Easily modify coffee recipes or add new types of coffee.
How It Works
The program displays a menu with coffee options.
The user selects a coffee type.
The program checks if there are enough ingredients to make the selected coffee.
If enough ingredients are available, the user is asked to insert coins.
The program processes the payment and dispenses the coffee.
If the payment is insufficient or the ingredients are lacking, the user is notified.
